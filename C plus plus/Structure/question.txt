ASSIGNMENT 04 (CLO 4)

Question 1:
Develop a C++ program for a library management system that uses a structure to store
information about a book. The program should define a structure named Book containing the
book ID, title, author name, and price.
It should use functions that accept structure variables by value. One function, getBook(),
should take a Book structure as a parameter, prompt the user to enter the book details, and
return the updated structure. Another function, showBook(), should accept a Book structure by
value and display the book information.
In the main() function, declare a Book structure variable, call getBook() to input the data, and
then call showBook() to display the stored information.

Question 2:
Write a C++ program that uses a structure named Employee containing an employee ID and
employee name. Create a function named createEmployee() that assigns values to the structure
members and returns the structure. In the main() function, receive the returned structure and
display the employee details.
