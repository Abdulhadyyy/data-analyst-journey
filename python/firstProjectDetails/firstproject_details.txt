Problem Statement
In modern software applications, calculators are widely used tools that require designing and
developing efficient, interactive user interfaces for performing mathematical computations.
Students are required to develop a web-based calculator application that allows users to
perform basic arithmetic operations in an intuitive and interactive manner.
The application must leverage Python programming for backend calculations and Streamlit
to provide a responsive, web-based frontend interface. This project emphasizes the ability to
apply programming concepts, modular design, and user interface development skills to create
a functional software solution.
Project Requirements
1. System Design and Input Handling:
 Design a user interface using Streamlit that allows the user to input two numerical
values.
 Provide options to select arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.
 Ensure input validation to prevent invalid or non-numeric entries.
2. Computation and Logic Development:
 Develop Python functions that perform the selected arithmetic operation on the input
values.
 Ensure proper error handling, such as division by zero.
 Apply modular programming principles to separate the calculation logic from the
interface code.

Output and Result Display
 Display the computed result clearly on the Streamlit interface.
 Allow users to modify inputs or operation choices and instantly see updated results.
